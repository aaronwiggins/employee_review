#Employee Review

##Description
Create classes, one for employees and one representing departments. The classes
should be created so they can track which employees belong to which departments,
find who deserves a raise, and how to distribute the raise to the employees.
While creating this assignment, I used test driven development (TDD). I tried to
create the error test first, run the test to make sure it fails, then write the
code to make it pass.

I used regular expressions (regexp) to parse through text representing an employees
review. Based on the expressions used, I created a method to determine whether
the review was positive or negative.

##To Run...
* Clone [repository](https://github.com/aaronwiggins/employee_review.git)
* Type `ruby employee_department_test.rb` into bash
