#Employee Review

##Description
Create classes, one for employees and one representing departments. They classes should be created so they can track which employees belong to which departments, find who deserves a raise, and how to distribute the raise to the employees.

##Requirements
Employess should be given:
* name
* phone number
* email address
* salary

Departments should hold employees and the information associated with them

Should be able to:

* mark an employee as performing satisfactorily or not satisfactorily.
* give a raise to an employee
* give raises to a department's employees, but only ones that have received a satisfactory review

Modify the method to distribute raises. Create a block that will only distribute the raise to employees above or below a certain salary. Use "yield" inside the block.

Use regular expressions (regexp) to parse through text representing an employees review. Based on the expressions used, determine whether the review was positive or negative.
